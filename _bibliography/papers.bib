  abstract={In this article, we propose a novel family of Lie algebra valued functions F_R on special orthogonal group SO(3) . Each function belonging to this family induces a novel controller that stabilizes a rigid body attitude. All controllers induced by the family FR form a controller class CR . This novel controller class CR contains both local and almost-global asymptotically stable controllers, and this article presents geometric stability results of the whole controller class C_R.},

abstract={A large number of both aerial and underwater mobile robots fall in the category of underactuated systems that are defined on a manifold, which is not isomorphic to Euclidean space. Traditional approaches to designing controllers for such systems include geometric approaches and local coordinate-based representations. In this paper, we propose a global parameterization of the special orthogonal group, denoted by SO(3), to design path-following controllers for underactuated systems. In particular, we present a nine-dimensional representation of SO(3) that leads to controllers achieving path-invariance for a large class of both closed and non-closed embedded curves. On the one hand, this over-parameterization leads to a simple set of differential equations and provides a global non-ambiguous representation of systems as compared to other local or minimal parametric approaches. On the other hand, this over-parameterization also leads to uncontrolled internal dynamics, which we prove to be bounded and stable. The proposed controller, when applied to a quadrotor system, is capable of recovering the system from challenging situations such as initial upside-down orientation and also capable of performing multiple flips.},

  abstract = {We present a methodology for studying the stabilization problem of a fully-actuated rotating rigid body. Since a rigid body attitude is represented by a rotation matrix in three dimensions, we exploit this fact and use each element of the rotation matrix as a parameter. This nine-parameter representation is global as well as unique, and results in a simplified set of nonlinear differential equations. We apply feedback linearization to design both local and almost global controllers. We also propose two novel definitions of feedback linearization functions, and prove that they lead to a well-defined vector relative degree and, as a result, almost-globally and locally stable controllers with bounded internal states. Using the proposed methodology, we present detailed examples of two such functions, demonstrating stabilization performance for each resulting controller on a rigid body system.},

abstract = {This paper presents a path following controller for a quadrotor UAV experiencing a single rotor failure. A smooth, dynamic feedback control law is proposed that allows the quadrotor to follow both closed and non-closed embedded curves while maintaining a desired velocity profile along the path when one out of four motors is completely disabled due to failure. The nonlinear model of the quadrotor is transformed into a partially linear model by a coordinate and feedback transformation. A path following controller is designed for transformed system that guarantees invariance of the path. The uncontrolled nonlinear portion of the dynamics (internal dynamics) are shown to be bounded.},

abstract = {This paper presents a position-based visual servoing control system that allows a quadrotor aerial robot with a single onboard camera to track a four degree of freedom relative pose trajectory with respect to a free-moving unknown target object composed of visual point features. The proposed vision system is able to estimate both the six degree of freedom relative motion and the target object model structure using only the images captured from the camera and recover scale using a minimal set of inter-feature point distances. An inner-loop attitude controller is used with an outer-loop position trajectory tracking control law to follow a relative trajectory with respect to the target object, while both bodies move in the inertial frame. The performance of the proposed algorithms are evaluated in simulation.copy; 2012 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc. All rights reserved.},
