  title={Global Accelerated Nonconvex Geometric Optimization Methods on SO(3)}, 
  abstract={This paper proposes global accelerated nonconvex geometric (GANG) optimization algorithms for optimizing a class of nonconvex functions on the compact Lie group SO(3). Nonconvex optimization is a challenging problem because the objective function may have multiple critical points, including saddle points. We propose two accelerated geometric algorithms to escape maxima and saddle points using random perturbations. The first algorithm uses the value of the Hessian of the objective function and random perturbations to escape the undesired critical points. In contrast, the second algorithm uses only the gradient information and random perturbations to escape maxima and saddle points. The efficacy of these geometric algorithms is verified in simulations.},

  abstract={This article addresses the design of a path following controller for a payload tethered to a quadrotor. Specifically, the goal is to design a smooth dynamic feedback controller that forces the suspended payload to converge and follow a large class of embedded curves. The given curve is treated as a smooth manifold, and set stabilization is used to find the maximal control invariant manifold. The controller design guarantees that once the aerial robot approaches the path, the payload never leaves the path. The performance of the proposed controller is verified through simulations with practical sensor noise and parametric uncertainties. Moreover, experimental implementation and verification of the proposed control scheme are performed on a Quanser UAV platform in an indoor flying arena.},

Stabilization on S^1},
  author={A. Akhtar and R. Sanfelice},
  abstract = {This paper proposes a hybrid geometric control scheme for the classical problem of globally stabilizing a pointmass system on a unit circle, as it is impossible to design a smooth globally asymptotically stable controller for this problem. Unlike most existing solutions that rely on coordinates and rely on a particular controller construction, our proposed solution is coordinate free (or geometric) and belongs to a class of controllers that we also characterize. Specifically, we propose a geometric hybrid controller that uses a local geometric controller (from the said class) and an open-loop geometric controller. The system achieves global asymptotic stability when each controller from the local geometric class is combined with the geometric open-loop controller using a hybrid systems framework. Moreover, the hybrid geometric controller guarantees robust asymptotic stability. Simulations validate the stability properties of the proposed hybrid geometric controller.},

  author={A. Akhtar},
  abstract={This paper addresses the multi-agent coordinated path following problem consisting of a class of underactuated vehicles capable of following a class of closed embedded curves in the three-dimensional space and proposes a solution using a nested set stabilization approach. The stabilization of the first set restricts each agent to the assigned path following manifold and ensures that each system stays on the path indefinitely when initialized in the neighborhood of the path. Stabilizing the second set, contained inside the first, solves the position, velocity, acceleration, or jerk-related coordination constraints. The third set, contained in the second set, satisfies the yaw, or yaw-rate-related coordination constraints. The reduction theorem establishes the asymptotic stability of each nested set, and as a result, the multi-agent coordinated path following problem is solved.},

  title={Path Invariant Controllers for a UAV with a Cable-suspended Payload using a Global Parameterization},
  author={A. Akhtar, S. Saleem, and J. Shan},
  abstract={Payload delivery using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has attained central importance for smart logistics and transportation systems in the context of the fourth industrial revolution. This work considers the problem of designing a smooth dynamic feedback control law for a point mass payload suspended to a quadrotor and making the load to follow a large class of curves that includes both closed and non-closed curves. Typically, the load path following problem is solved using either a coordinate-free or a local-coordinate-based approach. However, in this article, we adopt an alternative methodology. First, we express the system dynamics in an extended Euclidean space using a global coordinate system. Second, we propose two families of functions that lead to the design of almost-global and local controllers in terms of region of convergence. We cast the load path following the problem in the framework of set stabilization, and as a result, the proposed controllers make the given path an invariant manifold. The resulting controllers guarantee that once the suspended load converges to the path, it stays on the path indefinitely while satisfying other application-specific constraints. Finally, to complement the theoretical results, we provide a successful real-world experimental validation of the proposed controller on a Quanser QDrone UAV platform with a cable-suspended payload.},

In most use cases, the payload is required to precisely follow a given path for safe and secure operation in a cluttered environment. This work addresses the problem of designing a path-following controller for a point-mass payload tethered to a quadrotor. Specifically, we design a smooth
dynamic feedback controller that forces the suspended load to converge and follow a
large class of both closed and non-closed embedded curves. Using a local representation
of the dynamical system consisting of a quadrotor and the cable-suspended payload, we
show that the system has a well-defined vector relative degree. We treat the given curve
as a smooth manifold and then use set stabilization to find the maximal control invariant
manifold. The resulting controller guarantees that once the system reaches the path,
it stays on the path indefinitely. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed
controller through extensive simulations with practical sensor noise and parametric
uncertainties. Moreover, successful real-world experimental validation of the proposed
controller is demonstrated on a Quanser QDrone UAV platform with a cable-suspended

abstract={A large number of both aerial and underwater mobile robots fall in the category of underactuated systems that are defined on a manifold, which is not isomorphic to Euclidean space. Traditional approaches to designing controllers for such systems include geometric approaches and local coordinate-based representations. In this paper, we propose a global parameterization of the special orthogonal group, denoted by SO(3), to design path-following controllers for underactuated systems. In particular, we present a nine-dimensional representation of SO(3) that leads to controllers achieving path-invariance for a large class of both closed and non-closed embedded curves. On the one hand, this over-parameterization leads to a simple set of differential equations and provides a global non-ambiguous representation of systems as compared to other local or minimal parametric approaches. On the other hand, this over-parameterization also leads to uncontrolled internal dynamics, which we prove to be bounded and stable. The proposed controller, when applied to a quadrotor system, is capable of recovering the system from challenging situations such as initial upside-down orientation and also capable of performing multiple flips.},

Since a rigid body attitude is represented by a rotation matrix in three dimensions, we exploit this fact and use each element of the rotation matrix as a parameter. This nine-parameter representation is global as well as unique, and results in a simplified set of nonlinear differential equations. We apply feedback linearization to design both local and almost global controllers. We also propose two novel definitions of feedback linearization functions, and prove that they lead to a well-defined vector relative degree and, as a result, almost-globally and locally stable controllers with bounded internal states.
