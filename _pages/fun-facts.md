I thought about putting a fun little  "closed-loop" block diagram of my academic mentors -- I know, we (control engineers) love block diagrams and feedback loops. Throughout my research career, I was very fortunate to have the most amazing mentors. Not only my advisors, both Ph.D., and postdocs, were exceptional researchers, they are extremely nice and caring persons too. They all have inspired me a lot and I would not be here without their mentorship and guidance. Here is a fun little diagram that shows my research genealogy. I feel honored that, by following the arrows in the diagram below, I get connected with the greatest, the most inspiring, Professor Shankar Sastry.
