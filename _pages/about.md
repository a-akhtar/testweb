####  Postdoctoral Research Scientist 
- University of California at Santa Cruz, CA, USA
- University of Toronto, ON, Canada
- Queens University, ON, Canada
- York University, ON, Canada

***

Currently, I am a postdoctoral research scientist at the [Basking School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.ucsc.edu/)  at the [University of California at Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/). I am working under the supervision of Professor [Ricardo Sanfelice](https://hybrid.soe.ucsc.edu/)  at Hybrid System Laboratory [(HSL)](https://hybrid.soe.ucsc.edu/). 

Before joining the University of California, I held a postdoctoral research position at the University of Toronto, cross-appointed at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Queens University, Canada, where I was fortunate enough to work under the supervision of Professor [Andrew Lewis](https://mast.queensu.ca/~andrew/). I also had a research position at SDCN, a state-of-art drone lab, at York University, Canada. 

I completed my Ph.D. from the [Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/mechanical-mechatronics-engineering/)  under the supervision of Professor Steve Waslander at the [University of Watelroo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), ON., Canada in the area of aerial robotics and controls. Before that, I was in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/) at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), where I completed my MAsc degree in the area of controls and robotics. I earned a Bachelor of Engineering (BE) degree in Mechatronics Engineering at the National University of Science and Technology [(NUST)](https://nust.edu.pk/).
