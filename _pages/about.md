I am currently serving as an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Mechanical & Industrial Engineering](https://mie.njit.edu/) at the New Jersey Institute of Technology [(NJIT)](https://www.njit.edu/), located in NJ, USA.

I hold a Ph.D. from the [Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/mechanical-mechatronics-engineering/) at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) in Ontario, Canada, specializing in the exciting field of aerial robotics and controls. Prior to that, I pursued my MASc degree in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/) at the same esteemed university, focusing on controls and robotics. My academic journey began with a Bachelor of Engineering (BE) degree in Mechatronics Engineering from the National University of Science and Technology [(NUST)](https://nust.edu.pk/).

Before joining NJIT, I gained valuable experience as a postdoctoral research scientist at the [University of California at Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/) and [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/). My postdoctoral research journey also included a position at the University of Toronto, with a cross-appointment at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Queens University in Canada, where I had the privilege of working under the guidance of Professor [Andrew Lewis](https://mast.queensu.ca/~andrew/). Additionally, I was part of SDCN, a state-of-the-art drone lab at York University, Canada.
