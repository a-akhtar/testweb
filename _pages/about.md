Currently, I am a postdoctoral research scientist at the [Basking School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.ucsc.edu/)  at the [University of California at Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu/). I am working under the supervision of Professor [Ricardo Sanfelice](https://hybrid.soe.ucsc.edu/)  at Hybrid System Laboratory [(HSL)](https://hybrid.soe.ucsc.edu/). 

Before joining the Univeristy of California, I was having a postdoctoral research position at University of Toronto, cross held at the Department of Mathmatics and Statistics at Queens University, Canada, where I was fortunate enough the work under the supervision of Professor [Andrew Lewis](https://mast.queensu.ca/~andrew/). I also had a research postion at York University Canada.

I completed my Ph.D from the [Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/mechanical-mechatronics-engineering/)  under the supervison of Professor Steve Waslander at the [University of Watelroo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) , ON., Canada in the area of aerial robotics and controls. Prior to that I was in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/) at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), where I completed my MAsc degree in the area of controls and robotics. I earned a Bechelaors of Engineering degree in Mechatronics Engineering at the National University of Science and Technology [(NUST)](https://nust.edu.pk/) .
