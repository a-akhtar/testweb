<p>I am currently serving as an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://mie.njit.edu/">Department of Mechanical &amp; Industrial Engineering</a> at the New Jersey Institute of Technology <a href="https://www.njit.edu/">(NJIT)</a>, located in NJ, USA.</p>

<p>I hold a Ph.D. from the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/mechanical-mechatronics-engineering/">Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a> in Ontario, Canada, specializing in the exciting field of aerial robotics and controls. Prior to that, I pursued my MASc degree in the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/">Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at the same esteemed university, focusing on controls and robotics. My academic journey began with a Bachelor of Engineering (BE) degree in Mechatronics Engineering from the National University of Science and Technology <a href="https://nust.edu.pk/">(NUST)</a>.</p>

<p>Before joining NJIT, I gained valuable experience as a postdoctoral research scientist at the <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/">University of California at Santa Cruz</a> and <a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/">KAUST</a>. My postdoctoral research journey also included a position at the University of Toronto, with a cross-appointment at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Queens University in Canada, where I had the privilege of working under the guidance of Professor <a href="https://mast.queensu.ca/~andrew/">Andrew Lewis</a>. Additionally, I was part of SDCN, a state-of-the-art drone lab at York University, Canada.</p>
