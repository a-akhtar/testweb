<p>Currently, I am a postdoctoral research scientist at the <a href="https://engineering.ucsc.edu/">Basking School of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a>  at the <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/">University of California at Santa Cruz</a>. I am working under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://hybrid.soe.ucsc.edu/">Ricardo Sanfelice</a>  at Hybrid System Laboratory <a href="https://hybrid.soe.ucsc.edu/">(HSL)</a>.</p>

<p>Before joining the Univeristy of California, I was having a postdoctoral research position at University of Toronto, cross held at the Department of Mathmatics and Statistics at Queens University, Canada, where I was fortunate enough the work under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://mast.queensu.ca/~andrew/">Andrew Lewis</a>. I also had a research postion at York University Canada.</p>

<p>I completed my Ph.D from the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/mechanical-mechatronics-engineering/">Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering</a>  under the supervison of Professor Steve Waslander at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Watelroo</a> , ON., Canada in the area of aerial robotics and controls. Prior to that I was in the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/">Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>, where I completed my MAsc degree in the area of controls and robotics.
